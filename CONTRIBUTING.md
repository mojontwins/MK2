You can do anything you like to enhance the framework, but this is a short wish list:

- Translation of the docs in `/docs` to Spanish and other languages.
- Make proper use of makefiles to build everything and get rid of those filthy .bats
- Linux executables have been kindly added by jespicas, but they need maintainance. I don't plan to change much from now on, but mscmk1 and eneexp3 needs to be recompiled :-/
