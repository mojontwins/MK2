// Adds extra prints to screens

// Somewhat custom. You better use scripting if scripting is active.
// this is to somewhat embellish non-scripted games.

// The format is two bytes. XY and tile. XY = 0xFF is the end marker.
// Each screen with prints is an array. A final array has a pointer
// for each screen with prints, 0 otherwise.
